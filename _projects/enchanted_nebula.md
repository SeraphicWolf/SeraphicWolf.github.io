This is my first Terraria Mod, It's basically a mod with random space themed items (and a few random ones), Im still very new to making mods but im learning enough to make this one!

At the moment i do have a CurseForge page set up for the Mod, Its sort of finished and well made (i think) and soon i will be adding more things to the mod. Currently i am a one person team working on this.

I currently do not have a discord server made for this mod or for any other reasons. I do plan on making one at somepoint in the furture but for now this is where i will post new things about the mod.
