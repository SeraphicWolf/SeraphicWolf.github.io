✨Updates!✨

So I was recently commsioned to make a few Origins for the Minecraft Origin's Mod! I made about 7 for this person and they wanted me to Upload it on Curseforge!
So far a lot of people seem to like them as well as the Commissioner, I'm very happy someone liked what I was able to do for them. I plan on making more Origin's eventually but Ive got some fixing to do on my Imp Origin, it was brought to my attention that it seems to break when rejoining the game, making the player get stuck in a block they were standing on. I will be fixing this Shortly!
